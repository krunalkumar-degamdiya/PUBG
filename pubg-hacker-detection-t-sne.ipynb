That is why we use t-SNE to visualize that higher dimensional data in to lower dimesion.\n\n* t-SNE is very complex mathematical algorithm we will not dive in the maths here but you will get proper idea about t-SNE after reading this.\n\n* There is a phenominal blog about t-SNE, I have provided the link here. I just want to give full credits to the blog makers, its awesome!!!\n\nlink: https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/\n\n* So here our aim is just to visualize higher dimensinal data in to lower dimesion.......\n\n<font size = '+3' color='Green'><b>How t-SNE works?</b></font>\n\n### First we have to understand the meaning of each word in t-SNE\n* t- distributed = the whole t-SNE algorithm is based on t- distribution which is just like other distribution like normal distribution etc..\n* Stochastic = Means Probabilistic = Each time results may be slightly different \n* Neighbor = It calculates or uses distance between the neighbor points of a particular point.\n* Embedding = For every point in higher dimension t-SNE will create a point in lower dimension = mapping of each and every point\n\n### Working of t-SNE:\n\n* Suppose there is a higher dimensinal data set in which there are few clusters (of course we can not visualize it but it is still there).\n* If we want to create 2D plot of those clusters.\n* What is neighborhood ??  In simple term it is the points which are closer to each other right? And what is not in neighborhood?? The points which are farther away from each other...\n* Next question is how we can calculate that distance is far or not far?? Its simple \" DIstance formula that we have learned in 11th or 12th class.( Note that distance formula can be applied to even higher dimesions)\n* Note that : t-SNE will preserve the neighborhood, it doesn't guaranty about the farther point.\n* t-SNE will map or locate each point in 2D such that the neighborhood of that point remains the same as in higher dimension.\n* And that is it, working of t-SNE ...\n\n<font size = '+3' color='Green'><b>Where t-SNE fails?</b></font>\n\n1. When data clusters' sizes are different in higher dimesion then t-SNE fails to replicate that different sizes of clusters in 2D or lower dimension. (Cluster size means nothing in t-SNE plot)\n\n2. Distance between clusters in t-SNE lower dimesional plot means nothing. In higher dimension clusters are at uneven distances but it is possible that in t-SNE distaces are even.\n\n3. Sometimes t-SNE can create clusters which are origenally random points in higher dimension, which can mislead..\n\n### For more information and visualization I highly recommend one to read the previously mentioned blog.\n\n\n<font size = '+3' color='Green'><b>Common terms used in t-SNE:</b></font>\n\n### Perplexity:\n\nIt means the number of neighbors you want t-SNE to consider as in neighborhood.\nFor example; If Preplexity = 100% means t-SNE will consider all the data points in the data set as the neighbor of one another which will not create better clusters and there will be only one big cluster\n\n### Steps:\n\nMeans numbers of iterations you want to perform ... higher the iteration = better result = high computation time\n\n<font size = '+3' color='Green'><b>Tips to effectively use t-SNE:</b></font>\n1. Use Standardized Data\n2. Don't use any single Perplexity value, use many perplexity values and you will find different shapes in each perplexity values.\n3. Use fairly higher number of steps such that it will provide better result. Don't use too high value it will lead to higher time. Values between 3000 to 7000 are quite good but you can change according to your use and computational power.\n4. It is based on probabilistic approach so use same Perplexity and steps frequent time, it will give you slightly different result.\n5. In short try different combinations of perplexity and steps. Don't just depend on a single graph even it gives nice plots and clusters.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font size = '+3' color='blue'><b>Lets get
